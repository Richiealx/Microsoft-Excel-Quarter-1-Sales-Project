Quarter 1 Sales Report Analysis Project   Highlights
Hello Everyone, My name is Richard Frimpong, an intern from Quantum Analytics.

Below is my first project for data analysis.

#Project 1

Project Title: Quarter 1 Sales Report Analysis.

The tool used: Microsoft Excel

Datasets Source: Quantum Analytics NG.

Data Visualization Highlights:

Four different charts were used for the analysis of the Quarter 1 Sales Report

Top 10 Sales by Profit Analysis

The bar chart shows that the top two customers, Hunter Lopez, and Tom Ashbrook, generate significantly more profit than the other customers. This suggests that the company may want to focus more on retaining and upselling these high-value customers, as they have the potential to drive significant revenue growth.
By segmenting customers based on their profitability, the company can tailor its sales and marketing strategies to maximize profits. For example, the company may want to target its most profitable customers with personalized offers or loyalty programs, while focusing on retention strategies for lower-profit customers.
The bar chart does not provide information on the profit margin for each customer, which is important to consider when assessing profitability. A customer with high revenue may not necessarily be profitable if the profit margin is low. It may be useful for the company to gather additional data on costs and profit margins to gain a deeper understanding of profitability

Ship Mode by Profit Analysis

The chart shows that the majority of customers, 62.3%, prefer to use standard-class shipping. This may indicate that customers value cost-effectiveness over the speed of delivery. It may also suggest a need to optimize the standard-class shipping process to maintain customer satisfaction.
The chart can also be used to analyze the cost of each mode of shipping. For example, same-day shipping is the least profitable mode of shipping with only 8.72% of total profits, which may suggest that the cost of providing same-day shipping is too high.
The chart shows that First Class shipping is the most profitable mode of shipping, with 17.19% of total profits. However, it is also the least preferred mode of shipping, which may suggest a need to investigate ways to make this mode of shipping more attractive to customers.
The chart can be used to segment customers based on their shipping preferences. For example, customers who choose First Class shipping may be more willing to pay a premium for faster delivery, while customers who prefer Standard Class shipping may be more cost-conscious

Top 5 Products By Profit

The chart shows that copiers are the most profitable product, with a profit of $15,609 within the central region of the USA, followed by phones, binders, accessories, and chairs. This information can be used to inform product strategy, such as focusing on increasing sales of the more profitable products or improving the profitability of less profitable products.
The chart can also be used to analyze the product mix of the company. It shows that copiers and phones are the top two products in terms of profit, which may suggest that the company should invest more in these products to maintain or increase its profitability
The chart may also inform sales trends. For example, while all products showed a positive profit, Chairs were the least profitable. This may suggest a need to investigate reasons for low profitability of the Chairs product and implement strategies to increase its profitability.
Competitiveness: The chart can also be used to analyze the competitiveness of each product. Products with higher profits may indicate a competitive advantage or a strong demand for the product.


Monthly Sales Analysis

The line chart shows a general upward trend in sales from January to September, with sales peaking in September and then declining slightly in the following months. This suggests that the company's sales are generally strong and that there is a seasonal pattern to sale
There are several outliers in the data, including the high sales in September, November, and December, and the low sales in February and April. These outliers can be useful for identifying factors that may be driving sales and for making comparisons across different time periods.                                                     By calculating the year-over-year growth rate for each month, we can identify the months where sales are growing the fastest and slowest. For example, we can see that sales growth was strongest in September, October, and November, while sales declined in February and April.                                                     
There may be several factors that influenced sales during the year, such as changes in consumer behavior, the competitive landscape, or economic conditions. It may be useful to gather additional data.
